A small, single-binary CLI to manage a fleet of Linux servers over SSH:
generate keys, register servers, install keys, run commands, and watch a
refreshing metrics dashboard — for one host or your whole fleet.

![kay dashboard demo](docs/demo.gif)

Built with the Go standard library plus `golang.org/x/crypto` and
`golang.org/x/term` (the only third-party dependencies). Design: KISS, DRY —
one SSH path, one JSON store, a small in-repo TUI toolkit instead of a framework.

Part of the **Camelot** tools.

## Goals

- Make it trivial for a single operator to generate a key, authorise it on a
  server, connect, run commands, and watch a host's vitals — from one CLI.
- Stay tiny and auditable: minimal dependencies, readable code, no agent on the
  remote.
- Be safe by default: explicit host-key trust, confirmations for destructive
  actions, restrictive file permissions.

## Capabilities

- Generate and store ed25519 / RSA keys (passphrase-protected supported).
- Register servers (alias, host, port, user, key) in a local JSON store and
  select them by name or interactively.
- Print the exact `authorized_keys` install command for a server.
- Interactive shell (`connect`) and one-shot commands (`exec`).
- Tabbed, colour, refreshing dashboard: CPU, memory, disk, load, per-interface
  network I/O, top processes (instantaneous CPU), and Docker containers — with a
  cursor, selectable rows, and guarded actions (kill / docker restart, stop,
  logs, inspect).

## Out of scope (for now)

- No server-side agent or daemon; metrics come from standard commands over SSH.
- No password authentication, SSH certificates, or jump/bastion hosts.
- No multi-user or team features; state is per-operator and local.
- Not a replacement for full monitoring stacks (Prometheus/Grafana) — it's an
  at-a-glance operator tool.

The **client** runs on macOS, Linux, and Windows (the dashboard is best on
macOS/Linux and Windows Terminal; legacy Windows consoles need VT/ANSI, a
pending polish item). **Target servers are Linux/Ubuntu** with `sshd` and
standard tools.

## Security model

See [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md). In brief: public-key auth only; keys and config
stored `0600`; host keys pinned with confirmation on first use (`--insecure`
bypasses, for lab use only); destructive actions need explicit confirmation and
validated targets; no telemetry.

| Top-N containers by CPU/MEM (`docker stats`) | 💡 Idea | Costs a slower remote call |
| Agentic DevOps/SRE integration | 💡 Idea | Expose metrics + guarded actions as a structured tool/API so an AI agent can observe and remediate — deploy, restart/roll back, set/rotate env vars, run runbooks — gated by confirmations, `--read-only`, and an audit log |

## Requirements

- Go 1.26.4 (declared in `go.mod`).
- Remotes: Linux with `sshd` and standard tools (`/proc`, `ps`, `nproc`).
  `docker` is optional — the dashboard shows it only if present.

## Build

The first build needs network access to fetch `x/crypto` (and `x/sys`,
`x/term`):

```sh
go mod tidy        # resolves and pins x/crypto, x/sys, x/term; writes go.sum
go build -o kay ./cmd/kay
```

Or install the latest release directly:

```sh
go install github.com/Wigata-Intech/kay/cmd/kay@latest
```

Offline builds: run `go mod vendor` once (with network), then
`go build -mod=vendor ./cmd/kay`.

## Test

```sh
go vet ./...
go test ./...
```

Unit tests cover the config store round-trip, key generation + signer loading
(ed25519 and RSA), and the metrics parser against a fixture.

## Quick start

```sh
# 1. Generate a key for yourself
./kay key gen --name default                 # ed25519 (default)
./kay key gen --name legacy --type rsa --bits 4096

# 2. Register a server
./kay server add --alias prod-1 --host 203.0.113.10 --user ubuntu --key default

# 3. Authorise the key on the server (prints the exact command to run there),
#    or push it now over a one-time password login:
./kay install --alias prod-1
./kay install --alias prod-1 --push

# 4. Connect / run commands
./kay connect --alias prod-1
./kay exec --alias prod-1 -- uptime
./kay exec --alias prod-1 -- docker ps

# 5. Live dashboard (single host)
./kay dashboard --alias prod-1 --interval 2s

# 6. Fleet overview (all registered servers, one row each)
./kay fleet --interval 5s
```

Omitting `--alias` on `connect`, `exec`, or `dashboard` lets you pick a server
from a numbered list. `kay ls` shows everything you've registered.

### Dashboard (interactive TUI)

The dashboard is a full-screen, tabbed terminal UI with colour gauges, a moving
cursor, and guarded actions. It runs in the terminal's alternate screen, so it
never pollutes your scrollback and restores your previous view on exit.

```
Tabs    : Tab / Shift-Tab · [ / ] · or 1-5   → Overview · Processes · Docker · Network · Disk
Global  : r refresh now · +/- change interval · q quit
List    : ↑↓ or j/k select · PgUp/PgDn or ^U/^D page · g/G top/bottom · Enter details/inspect
Process : s cycle sort (CPU/MEM/PID/name) · x SIGTERM · X SIGKILL   (asks y/N first)
Docker  : l logs · R restart · x stop       (restart/stop ask y/N first)
Detail  : j/k ↑↓ scroll · h/l ←→ pan · g/G ends · / search (n/N next) · Esc/q back
```

The Overview shows CPU/memory sparkline history; on wide terminals it splits
into system gauges (left) and top processes (right).

Navigation is vim-friendly (`j/k`, `g/G`, `h/l`, `Ctrl-U/Ctrl-D`). The
inspect/logs overlay is a scrollable, horizontally-pannable pager with `/`
search that highlights matches and marks the current one. Pass `--read-only`
to disable all destructive actions (kill / restart / stop). Docker status is
colour-coded by health and active network interfaces are highlighted.

For demos and screenshots, `--anonymize` (or `KAY_DEMO=1`) masks the host, user,
alias, and Docker names so nothing confidential (IPs, hostnames, service names)
appears on screen.

Colour is automatic (respects `NO_COLOR` and `TERM=dumb`); force it with
`--color always|never`. Thresholds: green < 70 %, amber 70–89 %, red ≥ 90 %.
On a terminal smaller than 40×10 it shows a "too small" hint until enlarged; it
reflows on resize. Piping the output (not a TTY) prints plain timestamped
snapshots instead.

State lives in `<user-config-dir>/kay/` (`config.json`, `known_hosts`, and a
`keys/` directory of PEM files). Set `KAY_HOME` to override.

## Verifying locally with your own sshd

You can exercise the full flow against a local SSH server without a remote box:

```sh
KAY_HOME=$(mktemp -d)
./kay key gen --name local
# authorise it for your own account:
mkdir -p ~/.ssh && ./kay key show --name local >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys && chmod 600 ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
./kay server add --alias localhost --host 127.0.0.1 --user "$USER" --key local
./kay exec --alias localhost -- 'uname -a'
./kay dashboard --alias localhost --interval 1s
```

## Security notes

- Private keys are written `0600`; the config is `0600`.
- Host keys are pinned trust-on-first-use into `known_hosts`. A later mismatch
  is a hard error (possible MITM). `--insecure` disables verification — use
  only for throwaway/lab hosts.
- Only public-key auth is supported; password auth is intentionally out of
  scope.

## Layout

```
cmd/kay/main.go            entrypoint + subcommands
internal/config            JSON store (keys, servers)
internal/dashboard         interactive tabbed dashboard built on internal/tui
internal/fleet             multi-host fleet overview (kay fleet)
internal/keys              key generation + PEM I/O
internal/metrics           remote metric collection + parsing
internal/sshx              the single SSH client path (dial/run/shell, TOFU)
internal/tui               minimal stdlib TUI toolkit (screen, keys, widgets)
```

`internal/tui` is a small, dependency-free terminal toolkit (alternate-screen +
raw-mode lifecycle, keyboard decoding, a tab bar, and a scrollable selectable
list). It exists so the SSH/metrics layers stay UI-agnostic; if you ever want a
richer UI, it can be swapped for a library like `tview` or Bubble Tea with
changes confined to the `dashboard` package.

See [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the package layering and how the
reusable packages (`tui`, `sshx`, `metrics`) are structured for easy future
extraction into a shared module.

## The name

kay is named for **Sir Kay** — King Arthur's foster-brother and the
**seneschal of Camelot**: the steward who ran the court's household, supplies,
and logistics so the king and his knights could do their work. That's what this
tool does for your servers — it keeps watch over the fleet, keeps things in
order, and hands you the controls when you need them.

kay is the first of the **Camelot** tools: small, focused, single-binary
utilities named for the legend, each doing one job well. (Fittingly, the
all-seeing counselor **Merlin** is reserved for what comes next — an agent that
can act on your behalf.)
